# Future Features

This page lists planned features and improvements for the **Sprite Render Tool** that are not yet implemented but are on the roadmap.

---

## Planned Features

### Visual Debug Tools

- **Light Pivot Rotation Visualizer**: A visual debug tool to help visualize and adjust pivot rotation angles for cameras at different angles (not just horizontal). This feature was attempted once but could not be implemented due to Blender API limitations. It may be revisited in the future if there is significant user demand.

### Animation Features

- **Secondary Armature Sync**: Complete implementation of the secondary armature synchronization feature. Currently, the UI has placeholders for `sync_secondary`, `secondary_armature`, and `secondary_action`, but the functionality is not yet fully implemented.

## Feature Requests

If you have suggestions for features you'd like to see, please consider:

- Opening an issue on the project repository

**Note**: This is a living document. Features may be added, removed, or reprioritized based on user feedback and development priorities.
