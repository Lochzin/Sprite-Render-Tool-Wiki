# Future Features

This page lists planned features and improvements for the **Sprite Render Tool** that are not yet implemented but are on the roadmap.

---

## Planned Features

### Animation Features

- **Sub-Actions Mode**: Support for Blender's sub-actions feature (introduced in Blender 4.4). This new animation mode will allow users to work with sub-actions, which provide a way to organize and manage complex animation hierarchies within a single action. This feature will complement the existing ACTIONS, NLA, and STATIC modes, providing more flexibility for advanced animation workflows.

- **Secondary Armature Sync**: Complete implementation of the secondary armature synchronization feature. Currently, the UI has placeholders for `sync_secondary`, `secondary_armature`, and `secondary_action`, but the functionality is not yet fully implemented.

### Camera Setup Features

- **Custom Camera Presets**: Expansion of the existing preset system:
  - Custom preset creation and saving for frequently used camera setups
  - Preset sharing and import/export functionality
  - This will streamline the workflow for users who frequently work with custom camera arrangements beyond the standard presets

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Expanded Contextual Help Buttons**: Additional improvements to existing documentation buttons:
  - Deeper integration of contextual tooltips with direct links to specific documentation sections
  - Inline help buttons in complex property fields
  - These improvements will provide even more instant access to detailed documentation without leaving Blender, improving the learning curve for new users and serving as quick reference for experienced users

### Output Features

- **Normal Maps Rendering**: Option to render normal maps simultaneously with the regular render. This will allow users to generate both the standard sprite images and their corresponding normal maps in a single render pass, ensuring perfect alignment and consistent lighting between the two outputs.

- **Multiple Resolution Support**: Support for rendering multiple resolutions per camera or multiple resolutions for the same camera. This feature will allow users to generate sprites at different resolutions (e.g., 1x, 2x, 4x) in a single render batch, which is useful for games that need sprites at multiple quality levels or for different display densities.
