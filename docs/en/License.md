## License and Commercial Terms

This page summarizes the license and commercial terms for the **Sprite Render Tool**, based on `LICENSE.md`.

> **Note**: This document is an explanatory summary. For legal accuracy and full wording, always refer to the actual `LICENSE.md` shipped with the add‑on.

---

## 1. Nature of the License

The Sprite Render Tool add‑on:
- Follows the legal compliance requirements imposed by the **Blender API** and **GPL**.
- Provides the rights that are mandatory under that compliance (e.g. access to the source code when required by GPL conditions).

On top of that, there are **Commercial Distribution Terms** which regulate:
- How official builds are sold and distributed.
- Access to **updates** and **support** for paying customers.

These commercial terms do **not** remove rights granted by GPL; they regulate the **purchase** and **access to official versions**, not the legal status of the code itself under GPL.

---

## 2. Commercial Distribution Terms (Summary)

### 2.1 Individual License

- Intended for **1 user**.
- Allows both personal and professional use.
- Redistribution of the purchased file **as a commercial product** is prohibited, even if GPL allows code redistribution.
- Sharing the purchased download (for example by posting the original file or Gumroad link) violates the purchase agreement and may cause loss of access to support/updates.

### 2.2 Studio / Commercial License

- Intended for studios, teams, or multiple artists.
- Allows installation for up to **5 users per Studio License** (extensions on request).
- Includes priority support from the author.

### 2.3 Updates

- Buyers receive access to updates while the product is actively maintained.
- Third‑party redistributions (even when legally allowed under GPL) **do not include** guaranteed support or update access.

### 2.4 Support

- Support is provided exclusively to official buyers.
- Redistributed versions (e.g. downloaded from someone else) do **not** come with official support.

## 3. Warranty and Liability

According to `LICENSE.md`:
- The add‑on is provided **“as is”**, without any kind of warranty.
- The author is not responsible for direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use of this add‑on.
- The author may change, pause, or discontinue:
  - future support,
  - development,
  - update frequency,
at any time.

---

## 4. Important Notes

- The commercial terms **do not** restrict rights that are guaranteed by GPL compliance (for example, code rights that follow from using Blender’s API under GPL).
- They **do** regulate:
  - who is considered an official customer,
  - who is entitled to support,
  - who receives updates via the official distribution channel.
- Violating the commercial terms (e.g. sharing your purchase) can result in:
  - revoked access to future updates,
  - loss of official support.

---

## 5. Author Statement

From the original `LICENSE.md`:
- The add‑on is created by **Gabriel "Loch" Bonani (Lochzin)**.
- It is aimed at:
  - streamlining sprite sheet creation from 3D character animations,
  - supporting multi‑camera rendering,
  - offering automatic animation detection and customizable output naming,
  - enabling fast and efficient export of animation frames for 2D games and other creative projects.

By purchasing the tool you help support independent development and further improvements to the add‑on.
